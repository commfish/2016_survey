#ABSTRACT  

#INTRODUCTION  

#GENERAL BIOLOGY  

#OBJECTIVES  
##Primary  
 1. Estimate catch rates and abundnace of scallops by survey area with a coefficient of variation (CV) â‰¤ 20%.
 2. Collection of biological data (e.g., shell height, meat weight, age) for estimation of growth, mortality, and biomass.  

##Secondary  
 1. Record incidental catch (numbers and weight) of commercially important species and scallop predators.
 
##Tertiary  
 1. Address particular area management concerns.
 2. Special short term projects.
 
#METHODS  

Scallop abundance estimation based upno area-swept calculations where scallop density $d_i$ is calculated as:

$$d_i=\frac{c_i}{a_i},$$  
where  
$$a_i=l_i\cdot dW\cdot Q,$$  
and  
$$\bar d = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{i=1}^{s} d_i.$$

Density variance is calculated as  

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:density} 
\hat{\sigma }^{2}_{\bar d} = \frac{1}{s-1}\sum \left ( d_i-\bar{d} \right )^2
\end{eqnarray}

And 95% confidence intervals calculated as:  

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:ci} 
ci = \pm t_{\alpha=0.05}, n=df-1\frac{\hat{\sigma}_d}{\sqrt{s}}
\end{eqnarray}

where: 

$c_i$ = the catch of a species, either as abundance or weight, in sample haul *i*,  
$a_i$ = the nmi^2^ sampled in haul *i*,  
$l_i$ = the nmi towed for sample haul *i*,  
*dw* = the dredge width in nmi,   
*Q* = dredge efficency, and   
*s* = the number of stations sampled.  

An estimate of the surveyed population $\hat{N}$ will be calculated by expanding $\bar{d}$ over the defined bed area *A* encompassing all grid cells as: 

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:N} 
\hat{N}=A\bar{d}.
\end{eqnarray}

Variance of the surveyed population was estimated [@Seber1982] by

\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:var} 
\hat{\sigma }^{2}_{\hat{N}}=S^2\frac{s^2}{s}(1-(\frac{s}{S})),
\end{eqnarray}

where:  

\begin{eqnarray} 
S=\frac{A}{\bar{a} }.
\end{eqnarray}

A preliminary *Q* of 0.83 calculated from the Kayak ISland beds in 2004 [@Gustafson2012] was used in lieu of bed specific efficiencies.
