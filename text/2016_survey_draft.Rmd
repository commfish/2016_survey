#ABSTRACT  

#INTRODUCTION  

#GENERAL BIOLOGY  

#OBJECTIVES  
##Primary  
 1. Estimate catch rates and abundance of scallops by survey area with a coefficient of variation (CV) â‰¤ 20%.
 2. Collection of biological data (e.g., shell height, meat weight, age) for estimation of growth, mortality, and biomass.  

##Secondary  
 1. Record incidental catch (numbers and weight) of commercially important species and scallop predators.
 
##Tertiary  
 1. Address particular area management concerns.
 2. Special short term projects.
 
#METHODS  
Scallop size class designation. 

Scallop abundance estimation based upon area-swept calculations where scallop density $d_i$ is calculated as:

$$d_i=\frac{c_i}{a_i},$$  
where  
$$a_i=l_i\cdot dw\cdot Q,$$  
and  
$$\bar d = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{i=1}^{s} d_i.$$
where: 

$c_i$ = the catch of a species, either as abundance or weight, in sample haul *i*,  
$a_i$ = the nmi^2^ sampled in haul *i*,  
$l_i$ = the nmi towed for sample haul *i*,  
*dw* = the dredge width in nmi,   
*Q* = dredge efficency, and   
*s* = the number of stations sampled.  


Density variance was calculated using a nonparametric bootstrap resampling procedure with replacement.  Bootstrap percentile intervals were used to estimate 95% confidence intervals.  


An estimate of the surveyed population $\hat{N}$ will be calculated by expanding $\bar{d}$ over the defined bed area *A* encompassing all grid cells as: 

$$
\hat{N}=A\bar{d}.
$$

Variance and confidence intervals for the surveyed population were also estimated from the parametric bootstrap procedure.  


A preliminary *Q* of 0.83 calculated from the Kayak Island beds in 2004 [@Gustafson2012] was used in lieu of bed specific efficiencies. 

#RESULTS  
###Scallop denisty and abundance
Successful tows were performed in all five beds during either the May or July surveys (Figs 1 and 2). The average scallop density and abundance by bed were estimated along with their respective confidence intervals, and coefficient of variation (CV) (Tables 1 and 2). Scallop abundance calculations were performed for both size classes (small and large) and for all scallop combined (all). 

Discuss bed specific estimates and CVs.  

###Meat weight
Estimations of the meat weight ratio (round weight/ meat weight) were done using only large scallops that were sampled at a rate of approximately 10 per tow (Table 3).  The average meat weight ratio, along bootstrap confidence intervals, was calculated and applied to the abundnace estimates to get a range of meat weight (in pounds - lb) available by bed (Table 3). For illustration purposed only a rate of 5% was applied to the availalble meat weight by bed to get a hypothetical meat weight GHL.   
Additionally, the meat weight available by bed was also calculated from the total weight of the tows, again using only large scallops (Table 4). For this method the meat weight ratio calculated above was applied to the estimated weight of the entire bed to determine the meat weight and associated confidence intervals by bed.  The method in Table 3, using individual weights, was less variable in all beds, with the exception of WK1.  In WK1 the variablity around the meat weight estimate was higher using the individual weights, but the point estimates were similar.

##Abundance estimates by numbers
**Table 1:** CV of abundance for large scallops by bed, also sample size and area by bed
``````{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(knitr)
a <- read.csv('../output/bed_sum_table_Ndbar.csv')
b <- read.csv('../output/original_numbers_NO_BOOT.csv')
library(tidyverse)
options(scipen=9999) # remove scientific notation
b %>%
  group_by(year, Bed) %>%
  summarise (n = mean(n), area = mean(area)) ->n_area
a %>% 
  filter(variable == 'large')%>%
  mutate(dbar = round(dbar_b), cv = round(cv), N = round(N_b), cvN = round(cvN), size.class = variable) %>%
  select(year, Bed, size.class, N, cvN) %>% 
  left_join(n_area) %>% kable()
```

**Table 2:** Estimates of abundance and density with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals
```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(knitr)
a <- read.csv('../output/bed_sum_table_Ndbar.csv')
library(tidyverse)
options(scipen=9999) # remove scientific notation

a %>% filter(Bed=='WK1', variable=='all') -> wk1

##Meat Weight with large scallops ONLY

**Table 3:** Meat weight (lb) by bed from individual scallops with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals using estimated numbers of large scallops per bed
```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(knitr)
d <- read.csv('../output/bed_meatwt_table_Ndbar.csv')
library(tidyverse)
options(scipen=9999) # remove scientific notation
d %>% mutate(N=round(N_b),N_UL=round(ulN),N_LL=round(llN),ratio =round(ratio_bar, 3), ratio_LL=round(ll, 3),ratio_UL=round(ul,3)) %>% select(Bed, N,N_UL,N_LL,weight, ratio, min_meat_wt, meat_wt, max_meat_wt, meat_0.05) %>% kable()
```


**Table 4:** Meat weight (lb) by bed using weights from tows NOT individual weights 
```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(knitr)
e <- read.csv('../output/weights_meatwt_table.csv')
library(tidyverse)
options(scipen=9999) # remove scientific notation
e %>% mutate(W_lb=round(N_lb),W_UL=round(ulN),W_LL=round(llN),ratio =round(ratio_bar, 3), ratio_LL=round(ll, 3),ratio_UL=round(ul,3)) %>% select(Bed, W_lb,W_UL,W_LL,ratio, min_meat_wt, meat_wt, max_meat_wt, meat_0.05) %>% kable()
```

The western Kayak Island abundance estimate of all scallops was ```r round(wk1$N_b)``` with 95% CI of ```r round(wk1$llN)``` - ```r round(wk1$ulN)```.
