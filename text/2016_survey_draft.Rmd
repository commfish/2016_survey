#ABSTRACT  

#INTRODUCTION  

#GENERAL BIOLOGY  

#OBJECTIVES  
##Primary  
 1. Estimate catch rates and abundance of scallops by survey area with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤ 20%.
 2. Collection of biological data (e.g., shell height, meat weight, age) for estimation of growth, mortality, and biomass.  

##Secondary  
 1. Record incidental catch (numbers and weight) of commercially important species and scallop predators.
 
##Tertiary  
 1. Address particular area management concerns.
 2. Special short term projects.
 
#METHODS  
Scallop samples are analyzed in each survey area (bed) and categorized by size-class, large (>= 100 mm) and small (< 100 mm). 

Scallop abundance estimation based upon area-swept calculations where scallop density $d_i$ is calculated as:

$$d_i=\frac{c_i}{a_i},$$  
where  
$$a_i=l_i\cdot dw\cdot Q,$$  
and  
$$\bar d = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{i=1}^{s} d_i.$$
where: 

$c_i$ = the catch of a species, either as abundance or weight, in sample haul *i*,  
$a_i$ = the nmi^2^ sampled in haul *i*,  
$l_i$ = the nmi towed for sample haul *i*,  
*dw* = the dredge width in nmi,   
*Q* = dredge efficency, and   
*s* = the number of stations sampled.  

A preliminary *Q* of 0.83 calculated from the Kayak Island beds in 2004 [@Gustafson2012] was used in lieu of bed specific efficiencies. Density variance was calculated using a nonparametric bootstrap resampling procedure with replacement.  Bootstrap percentile intervals were used to estimate 95% confidence intervals.  


An estimate of the surveyed population $\hat{N}$ was calculated by expanding $\bar{d}$ over the defined bed area *A* encompassing all grid cells as: 

$$
\hat{N}=A\bar{d}.
$$

Variance and confidence intervals for the surveyed population $\hat{N}$ were also estimated from the nonparametric bootstrap procedure.  

An estimate of the surveryed population by round weight in pounds $\hat{RW}$ was also be calculated using the same equations as above.  

Meat weight biomass(lb) available by bed was calculated based on two alternative methods. A comparison of these methods was performed and the less variable method used. Both methods use the meat weight ratio calculated from the subsample of 10 large individuals from each tow (where they were available).  For every individual the meat weight ratio is calulated as: 
$$
r = \frac{MW (g)}{RW (g)}
$$
A nonparametric bootstrap procedure was used to estimate the mean ratio $\bar r$, variance, and percentile confidence intervals for each survey area (bed).  

The first method to estimate meat weight (lb) by survey area used the estimated abundance $\hat{N}$ in each bed and the mean individual round weight $\bar{RW}$ per bed:
$$
MWbed_1 = \hat{N}\bar r\bar {RW}
$$
The second method to estimate meat weight (lb) applied the same meat weight ratio $\bar R$ to the estimated round weight $\hat{RW}$(lb) of large scallops by bed:
$$
MWbed_2 = \hat{RW}\bar r\
$$
Confidence intervals for the meat weight (lb) estimates were calculated (using the above equation) from the nonparametric bootstraps performed on the abundance estimates (both $\hat{N}$ and $\hat{RW}$) and the mean ratio $\bar r$.  

where: 

*r* = ratio of round weight to meat weight for each individual,  
*MW* = meat weight, and  
*RW* = round weight.


#RESULTS  
###Scallop denisty and abundance
Successful tows were performed in all five beds during either the May or July surveys (Figs 1 and 2). The average scallop density and abundance by bed were estimated along with their respective confidence intervals, and coefficient of variation (CV) (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Scallop abundance calculations were performed for both size classes (small and large) and for all scallop combined (all). 

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(knitr)
a <- read.csv('../output/bed_sum_table_Ndbar.csv')
library(tidyverse)
options(scipen=9999) # remove scientific notation

a %>% filter(Bed=='WK1', variable=='all') -> wk1
```
Discuss bed specific estimates and CVs.  
The western Kayak Island abundance estimate of all scallops was ```r round(wk1$N_b)``` with 95% CI of ```r round(wk1$llN)``` - ```r round(wk1$ulN)```.

###Meat weight
Estimations of the meat weight ratio (round weight/ meat weight) were done using only large scallops that were sampled at a rate of approximately 10 per tow (Table 3).  The average meat weight ratio, along bootstrap confidence intervals, was calculated and applied to the abundance estimates to get a range of meat weight (in pounds - lb) available by bed using two methods (Table 4 and 5). For illustration purposed only a rate of 5% was applied to the availalble meat weight by bed to get a hypothetical meat weight GHL. The method in Table 3, using individual weights, was less variable in all beds, with the exception of WK1.  In WK1 the variablity around the meat weight estimate was higher using the individual weights, but the point estimates were similar.  

#DISCUSSION  
The primary objective of this survey was to estimate scallop abundance by survey area with a coefficient of variation (CV) ≤ 20%.  From the results reported in Table 1, only EK1 and KSH1 were close to that level.  Additional sampling would be recommended to achieve a smaller CV in the other three survey areas (KSH2, KSH3, and WK1).  A power analyis can be performed prior to survey implementation to determine the desired sample rate to reduce the CV.  

The subsample of scallops collected for more detailed biological data was set at a desired random subsample of 40 individuals.  Ten of these (large only) were further sampled to determine a meat weight to round weight ratio. A goodness-of-fit test (K-S test) was performed for each tow to confirm that the 10 random samples were representative of the 40 subsampled.  Using only the tows that had adequate sampling of large scallops (n>11) the majority of the time these 10 samples represented the entire subsample well (90% of the time).  The small percentage of the time (10%) that these samples differed the overall sample size was small (i.e. n sampled was <15).
